Introduction

I finally bit the bullet a couple of years ago. Yes, after much consternation, deliberation and outright dis-ease, I started calling myself at Data Scientist.

I know that's weird and unusual. Most people are looking for reasons to take that title. I don't know, I just never really liked the term. It just seemed weird to me.

Science is defined in many different ways, but fundamentally it is the systematic study of observations from the world around us. In other words, Science is the study of data. Science without data is not Science, it's Literature. So, what the heck is a Data Scientist?

Calling myself a Data Scientist always felt like a Writer saying, "I'm not a Writer, I am a Word Writer." Or, a Dentist saying, "I'm not a Dentist, I'm a Tooth Dentist." Or, a Comedian saying, "I'm not a Comedian, I'm a Joke Comedian." Or, an Airline Pilot saying, "I'm not an Airline Pilot, I'm an Airplane Airline Pilot".

I don't know. I just never liked the title. It took me a long time to take the plunge. Nonetheless, I am officially a Data Scientist. I have a business card and everything. I'm totally on the dark side now.

So, now I am a Data Scientist. Before that, I was a Statistician, an Analyst, a Researcher and a Consultant. I have had many titles, but I swear my job never materially changed.

My first title was actually my favorite and not on the list above. Long before I was an Analyst, Statistician or Data Scientist, I was an Economist. It's been a long time since I had that title, but it is still my favorite. Mainly because I love economics. The elegance and beauty of the dismal science always has and always will fascinate me. Using mathematical models to understand and predict human behavior is something that is just short of magical to me.

This series of articles is a fundamentally about old-school economics, but it is communicated in the context of modern data science tools. In the first article, I will walk through some basic economics concepts using Watson Studio, python, pandas data frames and a Jupyter notebook. In the second article, I use real-world retail data to estimate price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of revenue. In the third and final article, I show how to use data science tools and economic theory to assign price changes to 291 retail outlets.
